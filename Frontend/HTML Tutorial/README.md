# HTML Tutorial


## HTML - Overview
	HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.
	Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
	As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
	Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
	Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.
	
	Basic HTML Document:
	```
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		   <head>
			  <title>This is document title</title>
		   </head>
			
		   <body>
			  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
			  <p>Document content goes here.....</p>
		   </body>	
		</html>
	```
	Result:
	```
		This is a heading
		Document content goes here.....
	```
## HTML - Basic Tags
	### Heading Tags
		Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.
		```
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		   <head>
			  <title>Heading Example</title>
		   </head>
		   <body>
			  <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
			  <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
			  <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
			  <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
			  <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
			  <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
		   </body>
		</html>
		```
		Result:
		```
		This is heading 1
		This is heading 2
		This is heading 3
		This is heading 4
		This is heading 5
		This is heading 6
		```
	### Paragraph Tag
		The <p> tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p> tag as shown below in the example âˆ’
		```
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		   <head>
			  <title>Paragraph Example</title>
		   </head>
		   <body>
			  <p>Here is a first paragraph of text.</p>
			  <p>Here is a second paragraph of text.</p>
			  <p>Here is a third paragraph of text.</p>
		   </body>
		</html>
		```
		Result:
		```
			Here is a first paragraph of text.

			Here is a second paragraph of text.

			Here is a third paragraph of text.
		```
	### Line Break Tag
		Whenever you use the <br /> element, anything following it starts from the next line. This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.
		
		The <br /> tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. If you omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward slash character and just use <br> it is not valid in XHTML.
	
		```
		<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html>

			   <head>
				  <title>Line Break  Example</title>
			   </head>
				
			   <body>
				  <p>Hello<br />
					 You delivered your assignment ontime.<br />
					 Thanks<br />
					 Mahnaz</p>
			   </body>
				
			</html>
		```
		Result:
		```
		Hello
		You delivered your assignment on time.
		Thanks
		Mahnaz
		```
		
	### Centering Content
		You can use <center> tag to put any content in the center of the page or any table cell.

		```
		<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html>

			   <head>
				  <title>Centring Content Example</title>
			   </head>
				
			   <body>
				  <p>This text is not in the center.</p>
				  
				  <center>
					 <p>This text is in the center.</p>
				  </center>
			   </body>
				
			</html>
		```
		Result:
		```
			This text is not in the center.

								This text is in the center.
		```

	### Horizontal Lines
		Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document. The <hr> tag creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line accordingly.
		
		```
			<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html>

			   <head>
				  <title>Horizontal Line Example</title>
			   </head>
				
			   <body>
				  <p>This is paragraph one and should be on top</p>
				  <hr />
				  <p>This is paragraph two and should be at bottom</p>
			   </body>
				
			</html>
		```
		Result:
		```
			This is paragraph one and should be on top

			This is paragraph two and should be at bottom
		```
